# Physically protect your device and SIM

## Keep devices with you at all times. 

*	Avoid leaving phones or tablets out in public.

## Use a security code.

*	Add a Personal Identification Number (PIN), preferably 5 or 6 digits;
*	Change the default factory code;
*	Keep your code secret. 

## Monitor for tampering. 

* 	Mark your device with something unique and not immediately noticeable to help you identify it.  
*   If they can be replaced, mark your SIM card, memory card, and battery to ensure they are not replaced. 
*	Use tamper-proof security tape at the edge of devices that open easily. (Tamper-proof security tape is cheap and easy to purchase online in many areas.)

## Use an unlocked phone where possible.

*   If your phone is locked to a single provider, the provider has more control over your data. 
*	Consider whether your provider requires you to register personal information.
*	Ask someone you trust about unlocking your device. 

## Keep your IMEI number separate from your phone.

*   The 15-digit serial or IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number may help to trace and prove ownership if your phone is stolen.

To find your IMEI: 

*	Key *#06# into most phones; 
*	Look behind the battery; 
*	Check the phone settings.

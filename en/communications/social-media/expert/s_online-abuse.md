There are many different types of online abuse. 

# Blackmail

Blackmail involves threatening to reveal embarrassing or damaging information about a person to the public, family or associates, often to extort money or favours.

The information or images may be stolen (often through illegal hacking) or faked. 

Blackmailers may threaten to disseminate the information online, or demand money to remove images from websites that maliciously publish sexually explicit material without the subject's consent (see Revenge Porn).

# Cyberstalking 

Cyberstalking is a technology-based attack on a person for reasons of anger, revenge or control.

Cyberstalking may include:
*	Harassment and humiliation of the target;
*	Harassing family, friends and employers to isolate the target;
*	Tactics to make the target fearful;
*	Monitoring (e.g., using Facebook notifications to find out where the person is going, using spyware, activating GPS).

# Denial of service (DoS) attacks

Repeat visits or requests for information designed to cause your website or a service you use to crash. 

DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks use a network of computers to carry out the attack, possibly controlled through illegal hacking or malware.

# Doxing
 	
Publishing someone's personal contact information online to intimidate or punish them. It may accompany other abuse, like the publication of intimate images, or invitations to mob the target. 

Doxing (or doxxing) is an obvious violation of your right to privacy. Generally, in law, the right to privacy trumps freedom of expression.

Doxing may result in other, serious security threats such as SWATting, fake reports of dangerous activity to call armed personnel to the target's home.  

# Impersonation, identity theft, or hijacking

Impersonation involves creating fake accounts in someone's name, often to publish something that will discredit them. 

Identify theft or fraud involves stealing personal information to impersonate someone.  

Hijacking involves improper access to the target's account via illegal hacking or stealing the password. 

(Protect your accounts with [strong passwords](umbrella://lesson/passwords/0) and [2FA](umbrella://lesson/passwords/1).)

Accounts may be facked or hijacked to harass someone else. 

(Learn to detect hijacked accounts in the [phishing](umbrella://lesson/phishing) lesson.)

# Mob harassment

Coordinated attacks from multiple individual or bot accounts. 

Attacks may include message bombing, flooding the recipient with messages to overwhelm or temporarily disable a messaging account. 

# Revenge porn 

Private images published without consent for extortion, blackmail or humiliation, often by a former partner, is known as revenge porn. 

Revenge porn is an act of violence and should not be conflated with pornography.

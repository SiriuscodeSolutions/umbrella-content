# Blackmail

Blackmail involves threatening to reveal embarrassing or damaging information about a person to the public, family or associates, often to extort money or favours.

Emotional blackmail (like demanding intimacy) is also a form of extortion.

## Online blackmail 

Intimate images may be stolen (often through illegal hacking) or faked. 

Blackmailers may threaten to disseminate the images online, or demand money to remove them.

Online blackmail can involve the sharing of intimate photos online, including on 'revenge porn' websites (sites that maliciously, and without authorisation, publish intimate images).

# Revenge porn 

Private images published without consent for extortion, blackmail or humiliation, often by a former partner, is known as revenge porn. 

Revenge porn is an act of violence and should not be conflated with pornographic content.

# Doxing
 	
Doxing involves publishing someone's personal contact information online to intimidate or punish them. It may accompany other abuse, like the publication of intimate images. 

Doxing is an obvious violation of your right to privacy. Generally, in law, the right to privacy trumps freedom of expression.

# Cyberstalking 

Cyberstalking is a technologically-based attack on a person for reasons of anger, revenge or control.

Cyberstalking may include:
*	Harassment, humiliation and embarrassment of the person targeted;
*	Harassing family, friends and employers to isolate the person;
*	Tactics to make the target fearful;
*	Taking on the identity of the other person;
*	Monitoring (e.g., using Facebook notifications to find out where the person is going, using spy ware, activating GPS).

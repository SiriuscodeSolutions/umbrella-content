## Warning signs include: 

*   Changes to content or settings that you didn't make;

*   Correct account details that fail during log in;

*   Emails you are expecting regularly fail to arrive;

*   Information sent or received exclusively by email is known to a third party;

*   Account activity from an unexpected time or location.

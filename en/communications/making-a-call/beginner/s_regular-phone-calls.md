# Calls are not secure

## No end-to-end encryption

Calls from a landline or a mobile phone are not encrypted. 

## Easily intercepted

Mobile phone calls may be weakly encrypted between your handset and the cell phone towers, but calls are vulnerable to interception by:

*	Your phone company;
*	Any government or organization with power over your phone company; 
*	People close to your phone with inexpensive technology.

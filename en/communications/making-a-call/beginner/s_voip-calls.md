# Use secure VoIP 

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls made using the internet:

*	Are generally free or significantly cheaper than mobile phone calls;
*	Leave fewer data traces;
*	Can be encrypted end-to-end if both parties use the same (or compatible) software. 

*Note: conversations between VoIP and mobile phones use the mobile network, and are not encrypted.*

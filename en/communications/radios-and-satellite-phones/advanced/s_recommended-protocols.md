# Evade tracking

## Security protocols for satphones and radio frequency-based devices

*   Avoid using them from the same location more than once.

*   Avoid using them from a location that cannot be easily evacuated in case of attack.

*   Keep the maximum length of any transmission to 10 minutes. 

*Note: Some experts warn that 10 minutes could be too long, as instantaneous tracking is at least possible.*

*   Turn off the device and remove the battery as soon as the transmission is over and before traveling.

*   Avoid having multiple parties transmit from the same location.

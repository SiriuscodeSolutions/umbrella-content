# High Frequency (HF) radios

*	3 to 30 MHz frequency; 
*	Allow medium and long range voice communications (conceivably around the world); 
*	Signals can "bend" around hills, buildings, and other obstacles;
*	Work without repeaters.  
*	Commonly used brands: Codan and Barrett.

_Note:

*	Transmission range may be influenced by time of day; weather conditions; electrical interference; poor system configuration. 
*	It takes skill to achieve reliable HF connectivity over long distances. HF radios are often installed in vehicles or at base stations. 
* 	Generally more expensive than VHF and require more maintenance._

## Advantages: 

*   Short-range to extremely long-range communication without a relay station;
*   Less affected by topographical variation;
*   High degree of independence;
*   Easy to network, with multiple stations sharing the frequency;
*   Messages can be sent simultaneously to multiple destinations;
*   Easy to monitor;
*   Well-adapted for use in vehicles;
*   Adaptable to changing operational conditions;
*   Relatively cheap to purchase; 
*	No call charges;
*   Relatively easy to diversify functions of the network (voice, fax, GPS tracking, SITOR or PACTOR data transmission);
*   Possible to integrate with other networks (phone/email); and
*   Requires limited maintenance.

## Disadvantages: 

*   Not secure. Anybody can listen in;
*   Requires registration and licensing in most countries;
*   Transmission strength varies during the day depending on solar activity;
*   'Skip zone': no reception between maximum extent of direct wave (ground wave) and  longer radius starting with the closest reflections from the ionosphere;
*   Staff have to be trained in order to take full advantage of the network; and
*   Technical expertise needed for installation; HF can interfere with other electronic equipment if not installed correctly.

# Secret volumes

If an adversary finds encrypted files, they may use intimidation, blackmail or interrogation to force you to open them.

However, VeraCrypt allows you to create a secret volume inside your standard encrypted volume, to hide your most sensitive information.

Secret volumes are like a false bottom in a safe. An intruder may steal what they see in the safe, but miss the truly valuable content hidden beneath the false bottom.

# Alternate passwords

Set up secret volumes with a second, alternate password that is different from one you use to open the standard volume. 

An adversary will be unable to prove that the secret volume exists, even if they gain access to the standard volume.

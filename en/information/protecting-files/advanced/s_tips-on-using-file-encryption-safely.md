title: Tips on using file encryption safely
---
No matter how sturdy your safe is, it won't do you a whole lot of good if you leave the door open.

## Mounting and dismounting

When your VeraCrypt file container (or volume) is mounted, it is open to let you view your files. You must dismount (close) it to protect your files, unless you are actually using them.  

## Always dismount:

*   When you walk away from your computer for any length of time, including overnight. 

*   Before putting your computer to sleep.

*   Before allowing someone else to handle your computer. When taking a laptop through a security checkpoint or border crossing, dismount all encrypted volumes and shut your computer down completely.

*   Before inserting a USB memory stick or other external storage device, including those belonging to friends and colleagues.

*Note: If you keep an encrypted volume on an external storage device, removing the device may not dismount the volume. First dismount the volume, then disconnect and remove the device, even if you are in a hurry. Otherwise your files are vulnerable.*

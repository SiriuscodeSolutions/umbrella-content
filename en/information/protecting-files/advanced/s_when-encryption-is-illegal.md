title: When encryption is illegal
---
# Encryption is illegal in some countries. 

Downloading, installing or using tools like VeraCrypt might be a crime, regardless of what is actually inside your encrypted volumes. 

If encryption software could expose you to accusations of criminal activity or espionage, think carefully about whether it is appropriate for you.

## To protect unencrypted files: 

*   **Store only non-confidential information;**

*   **Use code words to protect sensitive information;**

*   **Keep sensitive information off your computer.** 

Carrying around sensitive, unencrypted information is usually a very bad idea, but it's possible to store it on a USB stick or portable hard drive if the device is in a very secure place. 

*   **Store sensitive information in a secure webmail account.**

You will need a reliable network connection and an advanced understanding of computers and Internet services to assess the security of this option.

# Traces remain

Even if you securely delete a file, including copies and backups, traces remain.   

Signs of a deleted file, such as its name, will probably continue to exist on your computer for some time, depending on the operating system. 

## Overwriting the entire disk 

Installing a fresh operating system is the only way to be 100% certain that records of a file have been erased.

> *You may be wondering, "Could I search the raw data on the disk to see if there are any copies of the data anywhere?" The answer is yes and no. Searching the disk will tell you if the data is present in plaintext, but it won't tell you if some program has compressed or otherwise coded references to it. Also be careful that the search itself does not leave a record!*

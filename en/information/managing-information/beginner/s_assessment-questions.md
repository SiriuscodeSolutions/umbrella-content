## 1. What do you want to protect?

What information could leave you or others vulnerable if it were in the wrong hands? Where do you keep it? 

* Email accounts?
* Contact lists? 
* Messages? 
* Files? 
* Where else?

*Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where itâ€™s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.* 

## 2. Who do you want to protect it from?

Which person or entity poses a threat to you or your work? Who has a motive to read or destroy the information you want to protect?

* A government?
* A company?  
* Your boss?
* A hacker?
* Who else? 

This is your adversary.  

*Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your assets.* 

## 3. How likely is it that you will need to protect it?

A threat is a bad thing that can happen. Risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. This question calculates risk. 

* Is it likely that your adversary will attack your information?
* Has it happened before?
* Has it happened to someone like you? 

*Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.*

## 4. How bad are the consequences if you fail?

### What is the adversary's motive?  

A company accused of wrongdoing may want to delete the evidence. Government officials may seek to arrest or harass an opponent.

### What is the adversary capable of?  

For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all your phone records and thus has the capability to use that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities. 

*Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.*

## 5. How much trouble will it take to protect it?

Some threats are rare or harmless. Some are easier to prevent than others. Some people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk. 

Which threats you are going to take seriously?

*Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.*

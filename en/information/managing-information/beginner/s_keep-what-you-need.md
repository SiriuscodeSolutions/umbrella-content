title: Keep what you need
---
# Two rules to manage information 

## 1. Keep only what you need.

If there is no good reason to keep sensitive information, delete it. 

(Learn more about [safely deleting](umbrella://lesson/safely-deleting)).

## 2. Keep it need to know.

Compartmentalise sensitive information that could put people at risk. This means you only know it if you really need to. 

> *Example: If your team is working with a high-risk source, keep her real name on a need to know basis. Her direct contact needs it. The rest of the team can use a code name instead.*

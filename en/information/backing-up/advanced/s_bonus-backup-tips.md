## Organise files. 

*	Move all folders containing documents to back up into a single location, such as My Documents.

## See if programs and apps with storage databases will allow you to choose a new storage location. 

*	If so,  put them in the same folder.

## Create a regular backup schedule.

*	Set a calendar reminder.

## Establish backup procedures for family and colleagues. 

*	Help them understand the risk of data loss.

## Test the process you will use to recover data from your backup. 

*	Recovery matters more than anything!

## Store backups securely. 

*	Backups must be separate from the original information. Don't keep your a USB stick with work backups in your office!

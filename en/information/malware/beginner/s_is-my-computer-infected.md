title: Is my computer infected?
---
Monitor your devices to make sure they are not infected. 

## Use anti-virus software

Anti-virus software combats malware. Use it on your computer and your smartphone. 
    
Anti-virus software can effectively combat the kind of malware used by criminals against hundreds of targets. It is usually ineffective against targeted attacks, such as those carried out by governments.

Examples include: 

*	[Avast](https://www.avast.com) for Windows, Mac, and Android.  
* 	[Clam Win](http://www.clamwin.com/), a free and open source anti-virus for Windows.  

## Use a scanner

Malware is very difficult to detect, but scanners can detect and protect against some malware.  

Examples include:
* 	[Spybot](https://www.safer-networking.org/) for Windows. 
* 	[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/) for Windows, Mac, and Android. 

## Look for other indicators 

### A warning email 
Some services alert you if they believe your account has been targeted. 

### Unexpected activity
You may notice a light indicating that your webcam is turned on when you have not activated it yourself or your settings have been altered to send copies of your emails to an unfamiliar email address.

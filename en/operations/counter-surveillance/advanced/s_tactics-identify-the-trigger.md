#  Tactics: Identify the Trigger

The trigger is the surveillance team member who initially alerts the rest of the surveillance team members (who will be spread out around the target in a box shape - to cover all possible directions of movement). The trigger is unlikely to move when you leave your location as that may draw attention to themselves.

The easiest place for them to be located is in or outside your location. They will usually try to stay in a place where they can stay without suspicion for a number of hours while observing you leaving the location. If the place you have entered has a number of exits then the rest of the team members may be spread around - with each acting as a possible trigger. Think about where you would be if you were on a surveillance team - look for locations and situations where it would not be suspicious for a surveillance person to be hanging around.

title: If you are Arrested
---
## Tell your team

Your first goal is to get outside support.

*	Ask to see a lawyer, speak to the embassy, or receive medical treatment if needed. 

*	Be persistent. 

*   Identify who you work for if appropriate.

## Take mental notes

Help your team understand the situation. 

*   Who arrested you? 

How did they identify themselves, and what agency are they with? 
What is their attitude? 

*   Where are they taking you?

*   Who else was arrested?

*   Why were you arrested? What is their agenda?

*   How much do they know about you and your work?

*   How long can they keep you?

## Mentally prepare

*   Stay calm; 

*	Prepare for a long wait;

*	You may be threatened, assaulted, cuffed, confined, or deprived of sleep, food, or water. 

_Raise abuse or issues with your treatment immediately, with the authorities who made the arrest, your team, and your legal support._

## Don't confess

*   Hostile authorities may seek to obtain a confession to support false allegations.

*   Avoid signing anything you don't agree with or written in a language you don't understand.

## Don't volunteer information

*	Be calm, helpful, and cooperative, but don't volunteer information.

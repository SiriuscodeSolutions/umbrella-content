## Parked cars

*   Park in well-lit, populated areas. 
*	Close all windows and lock doors before leaving. 
*	Have keys ready in hand on return. 
*	Check the back seat before entering.
*   Immediately lock doors upon entry. 
*   Keep a spare vehicle key in a secure location, like an office.

## While driving

*	Always wear a seatbelt.
*	Only open windows near occupied seats.
*	Open windows no more than 5 cm.
*   Do not speed or drive too fast for conditions. 
*	Observe local driving laws and regulations.
*   Avoid night driving or driving alone.
*   Keep the fuel tank at least half full.

## Avoid passengers

Passengers: 
  *	May not be covered by insurance;
  * May violate organisational policies if you are driving for work;
  *	May represent a security risk;
  *	May damage perceptions of you and your work. 

*For example, carrying a soldier as a passenger may create the appearance that you are travelling or working together and compromise your independence.*

## Don't risk your life

*	If threatened, provide transportation. 
*	In the event of an attempted carjacking, you should not risk your life to save a vehicle.

## Create a transportation policy

A transportation policy should include these, and other specific guidelines for your needs. 

The goal of the policy is to ensure:  

*	Vehicles are maintained; 
*	Journeys are planned; 
*	Vehicle users are prepared to respond to a range of possible incidents.

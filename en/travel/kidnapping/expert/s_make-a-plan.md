# Make a plan and carry it out

## Get advice

*   Decide whether to call in specialist advice, either from police or from a reputable company specialising in hostage negotiations.  

It may help if contact has been made with such a company before any kidnap occurs.  

_Specialist advice from a reputable company is strongly recommended if you lack expertise._

## Get what you need

*   Allocate the necessary human, financial and other resources to ensure that your plan has the best possible chance of success.
*	Create a logbook to record decisions, communications and events;
*   Obtain and mark maps.

## Need to know

*   Keep incident details strictly confidential;  
*	Implement a need to know policy.

(Learn more about this in [preparation](umbrella://lesson/preparation).) 

*	Bypass the usual chain of command if necessary; 
*	Exempt crisis management team from reporting to usual supervisors. 

## Manage communications

*   Decide whether to negotiate directly with the kidnappers, if that is possible, or appoint an intermediary.

_Using a trusted intermediary gives you time to consider how to respond to messages from the kidnappers, so is often considered preferable._

*   Maintain 24-hour communication channels;
*   Inform local police and other authorities, as appropriate;
*   Provide relevant parties with incident manager's contact details;  
*	Request that no action be taken without the manager's agreement;
*   Answer enquiries from the press, as appropriate;
*   Keep contact with relevant colleagues or agencies.

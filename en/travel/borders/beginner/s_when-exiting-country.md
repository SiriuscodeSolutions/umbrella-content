title: When Exiting Country
---
When leaving the country, the same principles as entering apply.

A cover story about what you have been doing should be:

*   Simple;
*   Easily repeatable;
*   Verifiable.

## Prepare for anything

*   Assume you will be searched. 
*	Assume that anything written will be read or copied.
*   Confiscation of your equipment is a possibility. 

		*	Back up files remotely. 
        *	If necessary, keep a small USB stick or microSD card somewhere harder to find.

# SMS is insecure

## Weak encryption

SMS (short message service) text messages are not well encrypted.

## Easily intercepted

Sent SMS messages, along with the sender and recipient phone numbers, are vulnerable to interception by:

*	Your phone company;
*	Any government or organization with power over your phone company; 
*	People close to your phone with inexpensive technology. 
*	People who get access to message history saved on your phone. 

Messages will carry the phone numbers of the sender and recipient as well as the content of the message. 

## Easily faked 

SMS messages can be altered or forged by third parties.

# Precautions

*	Avoid sharing sensitive information by SMS. 
*	If you do need to use SMS, use code words for sensitive information and to confirm the identity of the person you're communicating with. (Establish code systems in advance and change them frequently.)
*	Delete all received and sent messages immediately.

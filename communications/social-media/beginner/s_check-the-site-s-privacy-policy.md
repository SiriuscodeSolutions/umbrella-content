# Check the Site's Privacy Policy

Remember that information you post on most social media sites does not belong you - it is subject to the site's own policies, and they can use it or share it with others. We know that reading privacy policies is a near-impossible task, but it's worth at least taking a look at sections on how your data is used, when it is shared with other parties, and how the service responds to law enforcement requests.

Social networking sites often collect sensitive information beyond what you actually post - where you are, what interests and advertisements you react to, what other sites you've visited (e.g. through "Like" buttons). Be aware of what you like and repost if they may put you at risk. It can be helpful to block third-party cookies and use tracker-blocking browser extensions to make sure such information isn't being passively transmitted to third parties.

But this still leaves you with limited control over the information in your social media account. On April 4, 2018, Facebook [said] (https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/) Facebook information of up to 87 million people may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a UK company that promises businesses and politicians that it can use data to change audience behaviour. The information was collected by a third party app called This is Your Digital Life, and [included] (https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/revealed-aleksandr-kogan-collected-facebook-users-direct-messages) at least some direct, private messages exchanged between Facebook users who had installed the app and unthinkingly given it permission to access their mailbox.

title: Using PGP
---
Unfortunately, PGP has a reputation for being difficult to understand, or use. The good news is that there are many programs available now which can hide the ancient design of PGP and make it somewhat easier to use, especially when it comes to encrypting and authenticating email-the main use of PGP.

For detailed instructions on how to install and use PGP encryption for your email, see:

*	[Mailvelope (PGP for webmail)] (umbrella://lesson/mailvelope)
*   [PGP for Mac OS](umbrella://lesson/pgp-for-mac-os-x)
*   [PGP for Windows](umbrella://lesson/pgp-for-windows)
*   [PGP for Linux](umbrella://lesson/pgp-for-linux)

Storing your private encryption key on your mobile device may seem risky. But the benefit of being able to send and store emails securely encrypted on the mobile device might outweigh the risks.

# Understand the threat

No single solution will keep information safe for everyone. You must identify and understand specific threats before you can counter them.  

## Figure out: 

* 	What you need to protect;
* 	Who you need to protect it from. 

## This depends on: 

* 	Where you are; 
* 	What you're doing;
* 	Who you're working with.

This is called threat modelling. 

Conducting frequent threat modeling assessments is good practice.

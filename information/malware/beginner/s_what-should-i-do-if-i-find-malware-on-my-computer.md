title: What should I do if I find malware on my computer?
---
## Unplug

*   Disconnect your computer from the Internet and stop using it immediately. 

Every keystroke you make may be being sent to an attacker.

## Secure your accounts

*   Log into a computer you believe is safe and change your passwords.

Every password that you typed on your computer while it was infected should now be considered to be compromised.

## Seek help

*   If you can, take your computer to a security expert, who may be able to discover more details about the malware.

## Reinstall 

*   You may wish to reinstall the operating system (eg. Windows, Android, Mac OS) on your computer. This will remove most malware, but some especially sophisticated malware may persist.

*   You may reinstall files from before the infection. Reinstalling files from after the date of infection may re-infect your computer.
